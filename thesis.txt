The foundational difficulties presented by category theory make it difficult to formalise.
Nevertheless, it is possible to formalise category theory in higher-order logic, extended with a type of small sets, in a way that fits naturally into the idiom of the logic but can still express some basic but foundationally-challenging categorical results.
It is not obvious that this approach can be pushed very far.
A more satisfying formalisation of category theory will require a new way to resolve the foundational issues, a different logic, or a new approach to formalisation.
